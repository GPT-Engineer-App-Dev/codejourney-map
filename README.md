# codejourney-map

Design a landing page for NeetCode offering coding interview preparation with the following features:

- A header with:
  - A navigation bar with a logo, menu items (Courses, Practice, Roadmap), a Pro account button, a Sign In button, and a Dark/Light mode switch.
  
- Main Content including:
  - A hero section with a title, a tagline and a call-to-action button.
  - A flowchart section with a description and nodes and connections representing the progression and interconnection of various coding interview topics.
  
- The page should use a dark theme by default, but allow users to toggle between dark and light modes.
- The layout should be clean, minimalistic and focused on guiding users through the preparation process with clarity and ease.
